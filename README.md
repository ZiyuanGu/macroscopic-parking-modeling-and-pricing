# macroscopic-parking-modeling-and-pricing

Simulating an accumulation-based macrosopic parking model based on the macroscopic or network fundamental diagram (MFD or NFD) and implementing two real-time parking pricing strategies based on proportional-integral (PI) feedback control and model predictive control (MPC), respectively.
